<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is just one of the many publicly available implementations of ScriptableObject-based game architecture. This implementation, however, is focused on being versatile, feature-rich and editor tool-friendly.

Here are the premises:
* Variables and events should be designer-friendly. Custom icons and description fields work to facilitate that. 
* Variables should be highly versatile and transparent. This makes them more testable, powerful and tool-friendly.
* Unit tested. This makes modifying them easier and their use generally safer.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

If you're looking to test and try out the plugin before you commit, clone the repo and open the Unity project. The easiest and fastest way of testing if the project works is by running all tests in the test runner.
If you just want to download and use it, head over to the releases page and grab the latest UnityPackage.

### Prerequisites

This implementation of Variables and Events has been tested on 2020 LTS and 2019 LTS. They should work on previous and future versions of Unity.

### Installation

1. Download the latest UnityPackage and import into your project.
